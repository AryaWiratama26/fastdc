## 🧠 Groq AI API Key

To use the `!ai` command, you'll need an API key from Groq:

- Visit [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/)
- Sign in and generate your API key

---

## 📁 Training Your Bot

The `train_bot()` method allows your bot to respond based on your own dataset.  
Simply create a file named `data_train.txt` in your project root with Q&A pairs.

**Example format**:
```
Q: What is FastDC?
A: FastDC is a Python library for creating Discord bots quickly.
```

## 👋 Member Join & Leave Events

Welcome and farewell messages are built-in.

```python
bot.welcome_member()
bot.leave_member()
```

These functions send automatic messages to the **system channel** when members join or leave the server:

- `welcome_member()` → `"Hello {username}, Welcome to Server!"`
- `leave_member()` → `"{username} has left the server 🖐️"`
